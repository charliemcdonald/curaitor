This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## The Project

This is my final project for UC Berkeley's LS25 (Beyond the Uncanny Valley).

This project explores the intersection between forms of art and AI-generated imagery in a gamified manner.

## About Me

I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.

I have been self-studying web development, so I wanted a solo project to put my skills to the test.
